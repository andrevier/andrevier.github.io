# What are containers?

App development can be confusing if we are working together on many projects for the reason that each project demands a toolset to work properly in each machine. Therefore, its fundamental to have an organized system to deal with the demands of each task for everyone. To solve this problem at scale, specialists create the containers as an abstraction to hold all the dependencies to run softwares.

The figure below shows the basic structure of containers. Infrastructure and OS are the hardware and operating system of the host. The container engine has the tooling to bundle up all the app's needs to run in an isolated package atop the host's operating system. This feature gives lightweight characteristics, high efficiencies, and reduces costs.

The bundle of every dependency to run an app is called a container image. It also has: a custom file system on which the software operates; configurations; default commands to run; and other metadata. A single container image can also replicate inumerous containers through a container engine, as a formula. In the figure, containers C1, C2 and C3 are generated by the engine.

In simple terms:

Build an image: Pack everything your application needs to run.

Ship image: Send these images to wherever you want (cloud or local machine).

Run image: Execute your applications.
